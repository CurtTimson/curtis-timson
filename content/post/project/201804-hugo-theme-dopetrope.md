![Hugo Dopetrope Theme](/images/post/hugo-dopetrope.png)

Recently I ported the HTML5 template, Dopetrope, from [HTML5 Up](https://html5up.net/) to be used as a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) [theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/).

Out of the box the theme can be used as a simple blog site. A live example of this can be found here:

https://curttimson.github.io/hugo-theme-dopetrope/

Full details on how the theme can be used can be found on the README on the GitHub repo:

https://github.com/curttimson/hugo-theme-dopetrope

This is the 2nd theme I've ported following the [Massively](/post/project/massively-hugo-theme/) theme recently and welcome any feedback.

As always if you find any issues please feel free to [raise them](https://github.com/curttimson/hugo-theme-dopetrope/issues/new) or submit pull requests!
