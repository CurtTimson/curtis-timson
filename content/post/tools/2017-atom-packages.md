If you're unfamiliar with Atom, it's an open source IDE developed by [GitHub](http://github.com) which I currently use for front-end development projects.

When initially installed Atom isn't very rich in features, however it's heavily customisable through [packages](https://atom.io/packages). At the time of writing there are over *6000 packages* available to install.

## How to install atom packages
Atom packages can either be installed using CLI or through Atom itself.

To install through Atom go to **Settings → Install** and search for the package which you wish to install.

Alternatively installing via CLI is much quicker and requires only the following command:

```
apm install <package name>
```

## Packages

Below are some packages I recommend:

### File Icons

**Settings → Install → file-icons**

```
apm install file-icons
```

File Icons updates the tree-view and tab icons within Atom to show an icon which represents the file type. This is very handy when quickly trying to find a particular file, and also adds a bit of colour to the UI.
